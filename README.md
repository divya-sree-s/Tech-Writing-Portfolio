## Web pages:

I revamped the Catalyst homepage for the v2.0 product launch by ideating multiple prototypes on Figma and Excalidraw, eventually finalizing the current version of the webpage. Catalyst 2.0 marked a significant milestone in my Product Marketing career as it led to a complete shift in market positioning and strategy. This change influenced the target audience, messaging, content design, pricing, and packaging. Additionally, I devised unique names for our products and secured a trademark for each one of them.
