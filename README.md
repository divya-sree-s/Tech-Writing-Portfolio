# Technical Content Marketing
## About Me: 
Hey! My name is Divyasree, and I work as a product marketing specialist. I started my career as a Java Developer and worked for leading enterprises like VMware and Cognizant. A passion for writing paved the way to author several technical content collaterals at VMware. Currently, I work as a product marketing specialist at Zoho and mentor a team of two.

I love solving challenges at the intersection of product and customer success. My primary focus involves translating complex technical information into easy-to-understand ideas.
